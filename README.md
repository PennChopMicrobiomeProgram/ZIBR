# ZIBR (Zero-Inflated Beta Random Effect model)

## Introduction
The longitudinal microbiome compositional data are highly skewed, bounded in [0,1), and often sparse with many zeros. In addition, the observations from repeated measures are correlated. We propose a two-part zero-inflated Beta regression model with random effects (ZIBR) for testing the association between microbial abundance and clinical covariates for longitudinal microbiome data. The model includes a logistic component to model presence/absence of the microbe in samples and a Beta component to model non-zero microbial abundance and each component includes a random effect to take into account the correlation among repeated measurements on the same subject.

## Installation
You can install our ZIBR package from Github
```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chvlyl/ZIBR")
library(ZIBR)
```

## Basic Usage

```r
zibr(logistic.cov=logistic.cov,beta.cov=beta.cov,Y=Y,subject.ind=subject.ind,time.ind=time.ind)
```

- **logistic.cov**: covariates for the logistic component.  
- **beta.cov**: covariates for the beta component.  
- **Y**: the response variable (i.e the bacterial relative abundance). It is a vector with values in [0,1).  
- **subject.ind**: the variable with subject IDs.   
- **time.ind**: the variable with time points.   

The zibr function will return the following results:
- **logistic.est.table**: the estimated coefficients for logistic component.  
- **logistic.s1.est**: the estimated standard deviation for the random effect in the logistic component.  
- **logistic.est.table**: the estimated coefficients for logistic component.  
- **beta.s2.est**: the estimated standard deviation for the random effect in the beta component.  
- **beta.v.est**: the estiamted dispersion parameter in the beta component.
